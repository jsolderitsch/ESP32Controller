# ESP32Controller
Source and support files for ESP32 Controller for Tello drone and Internet of Things experimentation

Inspiration for code in this repository came from other code repositories on GitHub including:

[ESP32 Tello CLI](https://github.com/touchgadget/ESPTelloCLI)

and

[Tello Control with MPU6050](https://github.com/mohammadreza-sharifi/Control-DJI-Tello-with-Arduino-and-MPU-6050)

Initial configuration of this repo will be concentrated on Arduino sketch files that work with the ESP32 controller

Some design information about the controller circuit and its composition will also be contained here.

Some videos are available to show the controller assembly and the current programs in action.

Support is now available in a preliminary form for Gamepads. Dualshock PS3, Dualshock PS4, Switch Pro and more are supported.

Short video of the ESP32 and Gamepad in action is available at:

I want to thank Ricardo Quesada for his support as different controller types are being investigated.
