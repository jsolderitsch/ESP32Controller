# ESP32Controller
Source and support files for ESP32 Controller for Tello drone and Internet of Things experimentation

Initial configuration of this repo will be concentrated on Arduino sketch files that work with the ESP32 controller

Some design information about the controller circuit and its composition will also be contained here.

Some videos are available to show the controller assembly and the current programs in action.
